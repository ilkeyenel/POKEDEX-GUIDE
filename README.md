<h1> Pokedex-GuÄ±de </h1>

Hello! In my new project, I designed a Pokemon website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I fetched data from an API. I made the search button dynamic, and added a feature to convert Turkish characters entered into the search button to English characters, and also converted uppercase letters to lowercase. You can review the details in my code.
